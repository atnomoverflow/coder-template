## Gitlab Setup

The startup script included in this template streamlines the process of setting up GitLab access with SSH and the GitLab plugin. Here's what it does:

1. Generates an SSH key specific to your system.
2. Adds the generated SSH key to your GitLab account.
3. Uses the SSH key to create a personal access token for the GitLab plugin.

## Rstudio

To facilitate the setup of RStudio without the need for a subdomain, Nginx is installed and utilized to serve RStudio.
 
***üìù Note :*** 
the start script set password user coder password to coder that means you can access the R studio as 
```
user: coder
pass: coder
```
